SNANKE: FINAL DAWN SUPER REVENGEANCE is the greatest game of all time.

It's also a single- and multiplayer snake clone made in python.

Local multiplayer rules (different rulesets will be implemented in the future (maybe)):
-Whoever survives the longest, wins
-Crashing in borders, other snakes, or yourself will eliminate you
-Points mean nada (for now)

The longer you get, the harder you make it for your opponent, but also for yourself. This game is a therefore a test of pure gaming skill.
